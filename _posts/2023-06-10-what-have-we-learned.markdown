- [Anguilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguilla) is a small island of of about 16,000 people with country code .ai.
- whois tells me Vincent runs a [tidy auction](https://auction.whois.ai/) of expired .ai domains every month.
- I am not the first, but the only person this month, who thinks cromulent is a cute name for an ai domain.
- Also .ai domains are expensive and I probably don't need to act on every idle thought I have while washing dishes.
- embiggen.ai is also mine now.
- One does not simply serve a static website anymore.  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is neat, and using a [Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website) was a simple runner up.
